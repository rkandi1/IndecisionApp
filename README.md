# IndecisionApp

This app is completely written on the front end with no backend involved whatsoever. This was the first app I wrote using the React and ReactDOM libararies and utilized JSX.


The application utilizes the es6 syntax with JSX and the babel compiler. New features such as arrow functions are utilized and so are React Components and stateless functions used. App utilizes Webpack devtools such as webpack development server, source map for debugging on chrome and webpack client scripts. The application also has css, sass and style loaders and utilizes scss scripts to style the web application.
